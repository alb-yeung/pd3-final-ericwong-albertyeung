NAME				DATE				SHORT DESCRIPTION

Eric Wong			6.2.2014			Update README and create LOG, wanted to push map but couldn't SSH into school comps

Albert Yeung			6.3.2014			
Learned how to processing and made the beginning and started trying to piece the project together.

Eric Wong			6.3.2014			Finished the map, altered old MyQueue class to fit project, starting Monster class and the best-first search function it will utilize.

Eric Wong			6.4.2014			Did most of the best-first search function. Started a new class Box that will be expanded to represent each element of the map. This will make the search function most easier to code and clean up other parts.

Eric Wong			6.6.2014			Created Box class and its extensions. Need to learn how to associate an image with them. Altered helper classes so that they work with the search which uses the Box class. Added attack method for Monster class.

Albert Yeung			6.8.2014			Fixed up the Driver class to make it accept keyboard functions. Also, all the other classes need to be made in the processing or at least the extension needs to be changed to .pde. Not really sure how to input the Box class into the project because can't make arrays of Box class.

Eric Wong			6.9.2014			Starting graphics. need to use createImage() function and rectMode(). Going to need to draw the boxes and import images. array of box class works.

Eric Wong			6.10.2014			Began drawing the different types of boxes in GIMP. They are looking fine.

Albert Yeung		6.10.2014			Moved .java files to .pde files. Fixed the Box and the Item classes. Need to start to draw in the board.
