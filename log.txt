NAME				DATE				SHORT DESCRIPTION

Eric Wong			6.2.2014			Update README and create LOG, wanted to push map but couldn't SSH into school comps

Albert Yeung			6.3.2014			
Learned how to processing and made the beginning and started trying to piece the project together.

Eric Wong			6.3.2014			Finished the map, altered old MyQueue class to fit project, starting Monster class and the best-first search function it will utilize.

Eric Wong			6.4.2014			Did most of the best-first search function. Started a new class Box that will be expanded to represent each element of the map. This will make the search function most easier to code and clean up other parts.

Eric Wong			6.6.2014			Created Box class and its extensions. Need to learn how to associate an image with them. Altered helper classes so that they work with the search which uses the Box class. Added attack method for Monster class.

Albert Yeung			6.8.2014			Fixed up the Driver class to make it accept keyboard functions. Also, all the other classes need to be made in the processing or at least the extension needs to be changed to .pde. Not really sure how to input the Box class into the project because can't make arrays of Box class.

Eric Wong			6.9.2014			Starting graphics. need to use createImage() function and rectMode(). Going to need to draw the boxes and import images. array of box class works.

Eric Wong			6.10.2014			Began drawing the different types of boxes in GIMP. They are looking fine.

Albert Yeung		6.10.2014			Moved .java files to .pde files. Fixed the Box and the Item classes. Need to start to draw in the board.

Eric Wong			6.11.2014			Finished drawing all the images needed. Box class's graphics function will load an image to be displayed. I think we need to rescale the x and y coordinates of the boxes so that they match up to due to pixels. Need to write an updateBoard() function in Driver which will be run constantly to show where everything is.

Eric Wong			6.12.2014			Added action() functions in Box class that varies with type of square. Added receive function to Player, need to work more on player's inventory. Also, are we writing a separate player class that the user will be? Fixed Player and Monster classes.

Albert Yeung		6.13.2014			Commented out a lot of stuff that didn't work in Player, ArrayList, Box and Item. The Health Counter in the Driver class works and is testable by pressing the 'j' key. Reset it with the 'k' key. Wrote the Node class for the MyQueue. I don't understand why the MyArrayList class doesn't allow an array of Items and does not allow me to do Item[] and says that Item can not be found. Not really sure what's wrong with the Box and Player classes. It says that it's missing a '}' when it's clearly not. Also if you run Driver.pde it says "unclosed comment" but I can't find the problem. Woo barely made it before 3rd period.

Eric Wong			6.13.2014			Did some minor work at school, mostly spent the period trying to locate and resolve the errors that the processing compiler claimed there were but couldn't find any. Couldn't ssh into school and couldn't push at school but not too big a deal since not much was changed

Albert Yeung		6.14.2014			Made seperate folder which actually works. The moving and the visual health bar are testable. Not sure how to add the Boxes onto the frontier.

Eric Wong			6.15.2014			Read in map and convert from char[][] to box[][]. Need to fix box classes to differentiate between different types. Everything runs without errors :) Will most likely work on more later tonight.

Eric Wong			6.16.2014			Created the extensions to Box class and all the methods regarding graphics. HOwever, for some reason, the pde is not importing the files we ask it to load. They seem to be in the right folder and location and everything but it just won't load. Need to figure this out. Everything runs.

Albert Yeung		6.16.2014			Everything still runs and moved the rest of the files over. I'm not sure how you decide to make the Driver work so I didn't touch it.

Eric Wong			6.16.2014			Created map class so that the map can be universal. Added more functions to the driver to run the game like adding player and monster randomly. Still cannot figure out how to get the code to read the files!!!! program doesnt have error but not sure if theres an infinite loop somewhere. Shouldn't be one though.
