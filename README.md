Dungeon RPG (Like Pixel Dungeon Game) - Eric Wong & Albert Yeung Pd. 3

Basic: There is a big pre-made map consisting of rooms, traps, doorways, and mountains of treasure for you to fulfill your adventurous desires!
       As the character, you move around using keyboard input moving in the four cardinal directions, picking items up, or   attacking a monster which are randomly placed. One cool thing about this game is that you can only see a certain distance away from you and everything outside of your range is in complete darkness. This way, you will never know what lies around that dark corner. 
       Data structures that are being implemented in this game include queues for the field of vision, arraylists for storing the loot you pick up and the snazzy equipment you decide to wear, and 2D arrays for the beautiful map read by a scanner. Other algorithms that are being inplemented include the frontier idea and a best-first search to guide monsters.
       
       We will continue to update this as our game develops :)
